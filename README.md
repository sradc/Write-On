# Write On

[https://write-on.io/](https://write-on.io/)


This app is to help keep the drafting phase of writing separate from the editing phase.

It prevents you from going back. You can only write on.

Don't worry about mistakes until the draft is done. Build momentum and get into the flow.

Smart devices aren't supported yet, due to auto-complete, auto-correction, etc. (browsers don't seem to support turning these off?).
